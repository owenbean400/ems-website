# FRT App Tracker

### Description

The First Responder Time App's goal is to allow paramedics to focus more on the rescue and less time on keeping track of reports.
Consequently, this goal will increase the convenience of tracking times for a report.
The App idea was born after the frustration from an EMS chief.
Maine state regulations has paramedics facilities keep track of each rescue.
Keeping track with paper and pen is a hassle, error-prone, and unreliable.
That is why this app was developed.

### Use

The app will keep track of each rescue, specifically tracking the time of call, enroute, scene, transport, and destination.
Each change in action of the rescue will only need a push of a button.
At the end of the trip, the mileage can be recorded for reporting.
These rescue records is saved on the phone, which can be saved as csv file, written down, or sent to a server.
