# Response Time Track App

### Description

The Response Time Track App's goal is to allow paramedics to focus more on the rescue and less time on keeping track of reports.
It keeps tracks of the times of receiving calls, going on enroute, on scene, transport, and destination.
This data is saved for any desired use of the data.

### Use

The app will keep track of each rescue, specifically tracking the time of call, enroute, scene, transport, and destination.
Each change in action of the rescue will only need a push of a button.
At the end of the trip, the mileage can be recorded for reporting.
These rescue records is saved on the phone, which can be saved as csv file, written down, or sent to a server.

### Future

Currently, the offline mode has been launched on the app stores for Android and iOS.
The offline mode allows for users to record times on their phone hardware.
Login and having servers save data will take more time and cost to develop, which is a working process.
